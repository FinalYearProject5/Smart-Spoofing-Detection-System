ðŸŽ¯ Objective:
=============
Spoofing is a type of cybercriminal activity where someone or something forges the senderâ€™s information and pretends to be a legitimate source, business, colleague, or other trusted contact for the purpose of gaining access to personal information, acquiring money, spreading malware, or stealing data.

The main goal of this project is to create an authentication system that would detect if a given domain url is legit or fake website created to perform fraud.
